## Description

The `SwiftWin.ps1` script runs through a series of Windows maintenance tasks I commonly perform when cleaning up and optimizing a system.

## Options

The script's various functions are split into categories. Each category and its options are listed below.

### [WIP]

## Parameters

### -?

Show the script's help text.

```yaml
Accepted values: None
Default value: None
Required: False
```

### -Verbose

Displays extra information about each operation done by the script.

```yaml
Accepted values: None
Default value: None
Required: False
```

### -Reset

Force removal of the script's temporary files. This will delete any files the script has downloaded and reset the scripts current state. This will not delete any generated log files.

```yaml
Accepted values: None
Default value: None
Required: False
```

## Notes

This script assumes you already have knowledge as to how it works, and thus may behave in ways you don't want. This includes but is not limited to: changing system settings, deleting files, and continuing when you'd rather it wait.

I highly advise you have a look at the script for yourself, and modify it to better suit your personal needs, as opposed to blindly running it and hoping for the best.

With all that noted, I do plan on adding more friendly controls in the future.

This script was designed and tested on Windows 11 with PowerShell 7. No guarantees as to how well it'll work on other versions of Windows/PowerShell.
